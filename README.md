# Tensor-network-algorithms
As we can see from the partial success of Ising model describing phase transition, chains which composed of combinatorial objects and sites are important. In this project, we implement basic tensor network algorithms.

## Implementation of graph coloring based on heuristic methods in Python
    The following methods have been used:
    - Local search
    - greedy heuristic (logarithmic upper bound)
    - set cover based approach
    - bipartite coloring

## C++ optimum solver for mini graphs
    -  Assuming the number of vertices < 20
    - Complexity of calculating chromatic number is O(3^N)
    - to compile the solver in C++11 use command: make make mini_optimum_solver
    - to run the specified data file use command: ./mini_optimum_solver graph_file
